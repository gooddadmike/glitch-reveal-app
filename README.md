Reveal.js Glitch Template
=========================

Reveal.js is easy enough to host locally and setup but why bother?
When you can just remix this template and carry-on. *Note* don't edit this template. Remix (copy) it.

## Changes From The Original Demo
[Source repo](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js)

All the slides and functionality in the [original demo](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) are preserved with only the following changes.

 - The js, css and extra plugins are sourced from the jsdelivr.net CDN.
   - adding long files directly in glitch was failing
   - I don't know enough about express.js+glitch to know if there is a better way
 - I added a link to the default Glitch todo app and left that in tact.
 - I chose to delete the theme slide sinceâ€¦
   - The default theme is great
   - Dynamically changing the theme with non-local (CDN) resources didn't work.

### In case you don't know about Glitchâ€¦

I kept the default README.md intact.
